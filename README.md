# Baker's help
This script helps you calculate the ingredients for your sourdough bread.

# Input

## Approach #1
Ask for the amount of flour that the baker wants to use

## Approach #2
Ask for the weight of the final dough that the baker wants to reach

This project takes the 2nd approach

# Getting started
The script uses Ruby. Simply call it with
